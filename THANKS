This  program  was  started  because  I  wanted  to  learn  using  raw
socket. Later I understood it could become more  than a  simple source
file (as it was at the beginning).

I just want to thank two  persons which helped me in a very incredible
way in writing this code.

The first one is surely  Lorenzo Cavallaro 'Gigi Sullivan'.  He helped
me  in  solving  a lot  of  problems  during  my  "writing".  He  also
suggested  me the  idea of  receiving through  a  PF_PACKET/SOCK_DGRAM
socket and  this  is surely the greatest part of my  code. Without his
help my code wouldn't be what it's now!

The second  one is W. Richard Stevens. His works were  fundamental for
obtaining what I did.
