-version 0.6.0 :
Minor bug fixes.

-version 0.5.0 :
Now every kind of ICMP can be generated.
Minor bug fixes.

-version 0.2.0 : 
There were many  changes in handling and building  IP header.Now I use
struct ip_header_fields  for this purpose. I needed a solution of this
kind because I wanted ip_hdr_make() could work even when I'll add some
other   features   such  as   IP   options   without  modifying   main
(icmp.c). After few test I can say it works well.  
Now it's  possible to  generate some ICMP  error messages such  as TTL
exceeded and source quench.In this case  a fake IP header is built and
it is  located after  ICMP  header just like  it happens in  real ICMP
error  messages.  It's possible  for the  user to  build this  fake IP
header  too through command-line  options.  
It was implemented a new  timeout for receiving.Infact through the use
of a signal SIGALRM now when recvfrom(2) remains blocked for more than
RECEIVE_TIMEOUT seconds  it is  notified to the  user and  the program
continues.
Minor bug fixes.

-version 0.1.4 :
Introduced  a new  feature.Now when  -s  option is  not specified  the
program  reaches  to  obtain  IP  source  (reading  it  directly  from
interface)  and writing  it in IP header. In  this way  the  option -s
should  be  used  only  if  one  wants to  spoof  source  IP  address.
Introduced address name resolution for -d option.

-version 0.1.3 :
Added documentation (in italian).  
Minor bug fixes.

-version 0.1.2 :
Fixed a problem about timeout.In  the previous versions I used SIGALRM
for  implementing timeout  but  now  I reached  to  realize a  cleaner
timeout simply using sleep(3).
Implemented a  better approach for filtering  packets entering through
receiving socket.

-version 0.1.1 :
Fixed a minor bug in option -c.

-version 0.1.0 :
Introduced the  option -c for sending  a precise number  of ICMP query
packets.

-version 0.0.5 :
 Fixed a potential buffer overflow.  
Minor bug fixes.
 
-version 0.0.4 :
Minor bug fixes.

-version 0.0.3 :
Thanks to Lorenzo  Cavallaro 'Gigi Sullivan' I reached  to introduce a
receiving socket linked to a specific interface.

-version 0.0.2 :
Fixed the previous problem.

-version 0.0.1 :
The code is not good at all! It isn't able to  receive replies to ICMP
queries.
